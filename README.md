# PEST-Hub: AI-Powered Agricultural Pest Detection

PEST-Hub is an advanced web application that uses Google's Gemini AI to identify and provide management recommendations for agricultural pests. Built with Flask and Gemini API, it offers real-time pest detection and comprehensive pest management information.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run PEST-Hub on your local machine:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ installed
- Git
- Pip package manager

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PestHub.git
   cd PestHub
   ```

2. **Directory Structure**
   
   The repository includes the following important directories:
   
   ```
   PestHub/
   â”œâ”€â”€ public_assets/          # Public static assets (included in repository)
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pests/          # Images of pests used in UI
   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/             # UI elements and diagrams
   â”œâ”€â”€ templates/              # HTML templates
   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/css/             # CSS stylesheets
   â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                  # Main Flask application
   â”œâ”€â”€ .env                    # Environment variables (GEMINI_API_KEY)
   â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
   You can obtain a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

4. **Set up virtual environment and install dependencies**
   ```
   # Run the setup script (Unix/Mac)
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   
   # OR set up manually (Windows/Other)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment if not already active
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4000`

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter API errors, ensure your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly in the `.env` file
- For image processing issues, check that you have Pillow installed correctly
- The app runs on port 4000 by default (avoiding macOS AirPlay conflict on port 5000)
- Ensure you have an active internet connection for Gemini API calls

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ Dynamic Pest Detection
PEST-Hub goes beyond a fixed database of pests. Using advanced Gemini AI capabilities:

- **Identifies 12+ Default Pests**: Instantly recognizes common agricultural pests with pre-loaded information
- **Discovers Unknown Pests**: When encountering pests outside the default set, Gemini AI automatically:
  - Identifies the pest species and scientific name
  - Generates comprehensive pest information on-the-fly
  - Creates detailed treatment and prevention recommendations
  - Provides damage symptoms and organic/chemical solutions
  - Lists common species variants

- **AI-Generated Information Pages**: New pests receive full information pages just like the default 12, complete with:
  - Scientific classification
  - Detailed descriptions
  - Damage symptoms
  - Treatment methods (organic and chemical)
  - Prevention strategies
  - Common species information

This means the system can identify and provide actionable information for virtually any agricultural pest, making it truly adaptive to diverse farming needs.
